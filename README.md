# Oracle Patch Downloader

The Oracle Patch Downloader can be used to download a list of
patches from My Oracle Support.

It is written in Java and based on
[HtmlUnit](https://www.htmlunit.org/), which has the big
advantage that it simulates a browser very closely, including
execution of JavaScript.  This should (hopefully) allow for more
stable web scraping, even if Oracle should decide to change
anything in the logon or download procedure.  However, using
HtmlUnit comes with the disadvantage that this tool requires the
inclusion of quite some dependencies, resulting in a relatively
big executable jar.

There are other similar tools available, for example
[oracle_quarter_patch_downloader](https://github.com/lucaslellis/oracle_quarter_patch_downloader)
or [getMOSPatch](https://github.com/MarisElsins/getMOSPatch).

The Oracle Quarter Patch Downloader provides additional logic to
download important database and GI patches based on the Automated
Release Update (ARU) catalog.  However, it is controlled by input
files, while this tool is completely command-line-driven and,
hence, slightly more scripting-friendly.

## Prerequisites

- My Oracle Support Account
- JRE version >= 1.8
- JDK version >= 1.8 and Maven version >= 3.5.4 (only if you plan
  to build the Oracle Patch Downloader yourself from its sources)

## Usage

Download the latest release of the Oracle Patch Downloader jar
from its [GitHub release page](https://github.com/ojehle/H35_OraclePatchDownloader/releases).
Then start it as

```
java -jar OraclePatchDownloader-1.1.0.jar
```

which should bring up the short usage description shown below.

You can use this tool to download a list of patches, the regex
can be used to filter out files.  You can specify the patch list
and the platform/language list either as comma-separated lists
(`-x p12345678,6880880`) or through multiple repeated options
(`-x p12345678 -x 6880880`) or through a combination of both.

```
 -h : --help        help text

 -D : --debug       debug mode

 -Q : --quiet       quiet mode

 -d : --directory   output folder, default user home

 -x : --patches     list of patches
                    (e.g. "p12345678", "12345678")

 -f : --patchfile   file containing list of patches, one patch per line
                    (e.g. "p12345678", "12345678", "# comment")

 -q : --query |     list of platforms, releases, or languages
 -t : --platforms   (e.g. "226P" for Linux x86-64, "600000000063735R"
                    for OPatch 12.2.0.1.2, or "4L" for German (D))

 -r : --regex       regex for file filter, multiple possible
                    (e.g. ".*1900.*")

      --authmeth    MOS authentication method, one or more of "Basic",
                    "Legacy", or "IDCS", default "Basic,IDCS"

 -u : --user        email/userid

 -p : --password    password ("env:ENV_VAR" to use password from env)

 -T : --temp        temporary directory
```

### Specifying Passwords

Specifying passwords on the command line is inherently unsafe, in
particular on multi-user systems.  You should better enter the
password interactively in the console, which is the default if
you do not specify option `--password`.

Or you can store the password in an environment variable and pass
a reference to that variable in the argument to option
`--password`, as shown in the example below.

### Example

```sh
export MOS_PASSWORD="my secret MOS password"
java -jar oraclePatchDownloader-1.1.0.jar -u user@h35.li -p env:MOS_PASSWORD \
     -x 26749785 -t 226P,4L -r ".*1900.*" -r ".*19190.*" -d $HOME/Downloads
```

### Authentication Methods

The Oracle Patch Downloader can log on to My Oracle Support
through different authentication methods:

- `Basic`

  Basic (but nonetheless secure) HTTPS authentication.  In
  contrast to the following methods this one does not involve
  execution of JavaScript and, hence, is the fastest of all
  methods.

- `Legacy`

  "Single-paged logon", legacy authentication method.  Most
  likely obsolete since May 2024.

- `IDCS`

  "Two-paged logon", authentication based on Oracle Identity
  Cloud Service.

By default, the downloader tries to log on through basic
authentication first and, if that fails, then through IDCS-based
authentication.

To override the authentication methods being attempted, specify
one or more of the above methods separated by commas to command
line option `--authmeth`.  For example, to force the exclusive
use of IDCS-based authentication, specify `--authmeth IDCS`.

### Debug Mode

In debug mode the Oracle Patch Downloader dumps all HTML pages
that it processes to the output folder.  In addition, it logs
HTTP requests and responses to a log file, also placed in the
output folder.  The downloader uses file names
`dump-<hex-timestamp>-<page-title>.xml` for dumps of regular
pages and file names `error-<hex-timestamp>-<page-title>.xml` for
dumps of pages it could not process.

**Note that the log file most certainly contains sensitive data,
likewise for the page dumps.**

The Downloader uses the APIs provided by HtmlUnit to dump HTML
pages and log HTTP requests and responses.  The information
retrieved through these APIs differs from the actual data sent
over the wire.

## Installation

To build the Oracle Patch Downloader from its sources execute the
following commands:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:ojehle/H35_OraclePatchDownloader.git
cd H35_OraclePatchDownloader
mvn package
java -jar target/oraclePatchDownloader-1.1.0.jar
```

The resulting jar is self-contained and does not require any
additional dependencies during runtime.

## Contributing

As [experience has shown][issue_14], even the smallest projects need
at least some standards.  If you plan to contribute more than
just a couple of changed lines to the Oracle Patch Downloader,
then here are some instructions on how to prepare your IDE or
editor to not cause too much reformatting trouble.

### Eclipse

This project comes with project specific settings named `Default`
both for the Eclipse Java formatter and for Eclipse Java cleanup.
Plus it should configure Eclipse such that it runs a format on
each save of a Java source file.

Some notes on that:

- The project specific formatter and cleanup settings have been
  tested on Eclipse version 2024-03 (4.31.0).

- Ensure that the project specific settings are enabled by
  comparing `Project` &rarr; `Properties` with the following
  screenshots:

  ![Cleanup Settings](assets/eclipse-settings-cleanup.png?raw=true)

  ![Formatter Settings](assets/eclipse-settings-formatter.png?raw=true)

  ![Save Actions](assets/eclipse-save-actions.png?raw=true)

  "Enable project specific settings" should be checked on all of
  these, and on the former two screenshots "Unmanaged profile
  'Default'" should be selected as active profile.

- Probably better avoid doing full cleanups as triggered by
  `Source` &rarr; `Clean Up...`.  If you really feel you would
  need to clean up the sources in that way, do *not* use a custom
  profile, but rather the configured profile "Unmanaged profile
  'Default'" from the project as shown in the following
  screenshot:

  ![Cleanup Wizard](assets/eclipse-cleanup-wizard.png?raw=true)

- Unfortunately, Eclipse as version 4.31.0 with the given
  settings seems to behave slightly inconsistently when it
  indents or formats Java code: A continuation line of some
  wrapped line might get indented differently with `TAB`/`Ctrl+I`
  ("Correct Indentation") and with `Shift-Ctrl-F` ("Format").
  Mainly for that reason we have switched on source code
  formatting in the project's save actions.

- It is not clear to what extent the user-configured workspace
  settings from `Window` &rarr; `Preferences` can override or
  conflict with the project specific settings.  If in doubt,
  better review your changes in the Git perspective of Eclipse
  before comitting them.

<!--
  == Note: In file `.settings/org.eclipse.jdt.ui.prefs` there are
  == two complete sets of cleanup settings, one with prefix
  == `cleanup.` and one with prefix `sp_cleanup.`.  The former
  == set is used when invoking the cleanup wizard interactively,
  == the latter set is used during the save actions.  However,
  == the cleanup done during the save actions luckily only uses
  == a very small subset of all these `sp_cleanup.*` settings,
  == namely only `sp_cleanup.format_source_code=true` and
  == `sp_cleanup.organize_imports=true`.  See also [Eclipse bug
  == 178429][eclipse_bug_178429].

### Emacs

Install package `smart-tabs-mode` from [MELPA](https://melpa.org)
and add the following to your Emacs initialization file:

```elisp
(smart-tabs-insinuate 'java)
```

Some notes on that:

- The Emacs configuration has been tested on Emacs 28.2.
